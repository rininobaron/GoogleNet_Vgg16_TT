# GoogleNet and Vgg16 TT

This repository shows a "crazy" proposal for my Final Project in order to acredit the signature "Trabajo Terminal I" in  Bionic Engineering program.

The idea is use a convolutional neural network (inception network) called GoogleNet and coupled with an "old" architecture called VGG16 using Tensoflow.

It Works!
